This is a C# based .Net library that is used for Object Relation Mapping, it can map to multiple database types.  It also comes with a built in Class SQL language that uses classes names and properties to generate proper sql.  It maps enums into the database on the back end so it can go unnoticed by the code accessing the class.  It also contains a Lazy Loading concept to efficiently load data from the database and only completely load a class as required.  It currently supports MySQL, MSSQL, PostGreSQL and Firebird SQL.
